# The Story

`lan-chat` is one of the outcomes from the 0MQ Master Class given at FOSDEM 2015 by Peter Hintjens. More projects can be found at: https://github.com/zmq-fosdem . Also, during the class we had the opportunity do discuss and evaluate the future of 0MQ, you can learn about it here: http://hintjens.com/blog:84
